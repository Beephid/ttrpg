# DEATH & DYING
## INSTANT DEATH
- If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and the remaining damage equals your Hit Point maximum, you die instantly.

## UNCONSCIOUS
- If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and does not kill you, you fall unconscious. It ends if you regain any hit points.

## DEATH SAVING THROWS
- Every turn that begins at 0 hit points and you are not stable, you are dying.
- ROLL d20 with no modifiers. A roll of 10 or higher is a success. A roll of 9 or lower is a failure.
- 3 successes mean that the character is stabilized: unconscious with 0 hit points, but alive.
- 3 failures mean that the character is dead.
- A natural 1 counts as two failures / A natural 20 heals the character 1 hit point.
- Any damage received while at 0 hit points counts as a death saving throw failure.
- Any critical hit counts as 2 failures. If damage exceeds the hit point max, the PC dies.

## DYING is an ordeal (HouseRule)
- If you fail a death saving throw by more than 5 (roll a 1-4 with modifiers), you take one point of Exhaustion as your body fights to stay alive.

## DEATH is definitely an ordeal (HouseRule)
- Roll a d100 when being revived by spells that require only an action (e.g., Revivify). In addition to any penalties listed in the spell, you suffer from the effects of short-term madness as a result of the mental and physical trauma of returning to life.
- Roll a d100 when being revived by spells that require a ritual or more than an action. In addition to any penalties listed in the spell, you suffer from the effects of long-term madness as a result of the physical and mental trauma of regeneration and having your soul yanked back from the beyond.

## STABILIZING ANOTHER
- If healing is unavailable, a player can stabilize an unconscious, dying PC.
- Using an Action on your turn, ROLL a Medicine (WIS) check vs. a DC 10 to stabilize successfully.
- A stable PC has 0 hit points and remains unconscious. A stable PC heals 1 hit point after 1d4 hours. Any damage taken while stable restarts the Death Saving Throw process.
