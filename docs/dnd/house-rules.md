# **House Rules and Expectations for games with Brett as the DM** 

## **Player, Behavior, Game Behavior & DM Expectations**

### *Player Attention*
-  This game is intended to be on the casual side and interruptions are expected. If, for some reason, there is a significant, consistent hold-up, especially during combat, the DM will rule the PC takes the Dodge action for that round, and the game moves on.
- Combat happens in turns - it is the slowest part of the game. It will be especially slow at first as folks learn how to use their character sheet and what to roll. You are welcome to pop out mentally/physically when it’s not your turn, HOWEVER, make sure you know what you want to do when your turn comes. 
  - Use other people’s turns to plan. Look over your character sheet. Learn your abilities. This significantly speeds up combat!
    
### *Unannounced dice rolls*
- Please wait for the DM to ask for a roll before making one. On the other hand, if you feel another skill check would be appropriate based on your character, feel free to ask!
    
### *Dice rolls against one another*
- Only when prompted by the DM and if both parties consent.
    
### *Player Vs Player* 
- No hostile actions against another player are allowed without prior notification to the DM. Mutually consented, non-lethal duels are fine.
    
### *PC Secrets*
- It's generally fine for players and/or their characters to keep secrets from other players SO LONG AS they continue to be an amicable members of the party. It's best the DM is kept in the loop on any plans or secrets so the story can proceed in the best interest of everyone.
    
### *Player Expectations, Types, Goals & Diversity*
- Everyone has a part of the game they enjoy most, be it combat, exploration, or social encounters. Please let me know if the game is not proceeding in a direction you enjoy, but also keep in mind what others are looking for in the game.

### *Player Discomfort*
- Let me know immediately if anything that is said or happens in the game is uncomfortable (privately or out loud). Generally, I will seek to avoid topics that may cause discomfort, but everyone has varying degrees of interest and tolerance of encounters involving e.g., slavery, dismemberment, horror themes, etc. Sexual themes and violence toward children are among the themes absolutely banned from the table. We can retcon story elements as needed.

### *Murder Hobos*
- Unless we are explicitly playing an "evil" campaign, please understand that killing non-hostile NPCs is likely to have adverse effects on your character and the game for everyone.
    
### *Player Agency* 
- I encourage you to exercise agency in your character's path/story. Discuss with me and make suggestions at any time. We can invent new NPCs, new locations, and anything that makes the game funner for you!
    
### *Game Balance & Fairness*
- In general, I don't believe it is the DM's job to kill the player's characters. Ideally, things should feel appropriately challenging if you make smart choices about your progression. I do believe that there should be risks though, otherwise, nothing feels truly dangerous. Making poor choices (like attacking a dragon's lair at level 1 or jumping from a 500ft cliff) can and probably will result in your character's demise.
    
### *Rules Debates* 
- If contention or confusion around a rule comes up, I will generally make a quick ruling (that often favors the player) and look up the correct rule later. This does mean something may work the first time, but not again.
    
### *Spotlight Sharing*
- Please speak up if you feel your character is not getting enough opportunity to act or does not feel as much a part of the story as you would like!

### *Meta-knowledge*
- You probably know that swinging a non-magical sword at a ghost isn't likely to harm it, but your character may not. Consider if there is any reason your character may know things like this before taking action. Likely, I will ask for a roll to see if your character is aware of something of the sort.
- Likewise, if your party member investigates the area and fails to detect any traps, you will need a very good reason to doubt them and check again yourself. Generally speaking, there is only one such check per "locale".
- We are likely to use published adventures - please don’t spoil anything for yourself! There’s also a good chance I’ve changed the details or outcomes and things may not go as you read.
    
### *Min-Maxing*
- Choose the character traits and abilities that you want to play. Don’t worry too much if your character is not “optimal”. If you have any concerns about your character’s strength - let me know! 
- Try to have some non-combat abilities and skills to spice up the other 80% of the game. 
- D&D is a very balanced game and you can get away with basically anything within reason.

### *Alcohol*
- Drinking is fine, as long as you're a good sport about it.
    
### *Player Absences* 
- Let me know if it's alright for you for the "show to go on" in your absence. Are you alright with me taking over your character (with the best intentions to keep them alive)?
- I'll keep a game going with even 1 person if the setting calls for it. It's possible present players get in some 'down-time' play that can provide minor benefits or perhaps progresses some downtime activities that they had going on.

## **Character Creation**
    
### *Creation Stats* 
- We will, in general, use standard array or point buy. Check with me if you're unsure.
- You may choose to roll for HP increases. If you fail to roll above the average, take the average.
    
### *Alignment*
- You may use alignment to guide your character's actions if you choose, but it is not required. I do not use alignment for players for any reason. Alignment exists for NPCs and monsters for the purpose of spells like Detect Good and Evil, but is otherwise not used.
    
### *Stat assignment House Rule - FLOATING STAT POINT*
- Generally speaking, every creature race has a +2/+1 configuration for ability score bonuses. - You can take any single point (move the +1 OR separate the +2, e.g., +1/+1/+1) and assign it to another ability score not already receiving a bonus.

## **House Rules for Game Mechanics**
    
 ### *Inspiration*
 - Inspiration is drawn from a deck of playing cards and liberally applied during moments of good decision making, improvisation, or role play. Add the number of the card to any d20 roll. Number cards = face value, Face card = +11, Ace = auto-crit.
 - Inspiration expires at the end of session.
    
### *Helping/Giving Aid*
- Helping/Giving Aid can give advantage to another character if the character helping has proficiency in that skill.

### *Attunement/Identify*
   - If it can be attuned to (you have three slots for attuned items), you can learn details about the items abilities during the attunement (a short rest of inspection/experimentation). This does not necessarily reveal all of its capabilities if there are certain circumstances that change its power/abilities. It also does not reveal curses or similar. Identify spells or Detect Curse spells can circumvent the shortfalls.
- Non-attunable items require experimentation (i.e., trying to use it) or an Identify spell.
    
### *Material Components* 
- Verify you can reasonably obtain the spell components for the spells you wish to cast. Check with me if you are not sure and see if it is possible for your character to obtain the required materials.
- Non-magical arrows/bolts do not need to be tracked. Magical arrows (including +1) do.
- If you throw your handaxes, expect that you will need to retrieve them.
 
### *Resting Rules*
- Long rests can only occur in a place of reasonable safety. Do not expect to be able to sleep for 8 hours in a dungeon with enemies within without extreme precautions.

### *Healing Potions*
- You may drink a healing potion as a Bonus Action if your Action does not affect a hostile creature (normally, this is a Use Magic Item Action). 
- Administering a potion to another player/NPC is still an Action.
- Recover max HP when drinking a potion (instead of rolling).

### *Dying is an ordeal*
- If you fail a death saving throw by more than 5 (roll a 1-4 with modifiers), the number of death saving throws required to die is reduced by 1 until your next long rest. (max 3)
- Death Saving Throws are made in secret (roll privately to the DM).

### *Death is definitely an ordeal*
- Roll a d100 when being revived by spells that require only an action (e.g., Revivify). In addition to any penalties listed in the spell, you suffer from the effects of short term madness as a result of mental and physical trauma of returning to life.
- Roll a d100 when being revived by spells that require a ritual or more than an action. In addition to any penalties listed in the spell, you suffer from the effects of long term madness as a result of the physical and mental trauma of regeneration and having your soul yanked back from the beyond.

### *Action Surge* (Fighter feature)
> Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. In your turn, you can take one additional Action.
  
- HR: For Two-Weapon Fighting, you also gain an additional Bonus Action attack if your *Action Surge* Action was an attack.
  
> Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.
