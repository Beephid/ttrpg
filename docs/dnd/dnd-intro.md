## Wtf is D&D?

What if you made a video game where you could do absolutely anything, without the limitations of technology or what the developers implemented:

- Backflip off a table and stab Bob, the random NPC at a tavern, who made fun of your wig.
- Pick up the mug on the table and throw it at Bob.
- Convince Bob that the wig is actually a powerful, sentient creature who is not happy with what he just said.
- Turn Bob into a goat.
- Burn down Bob’s house.
- Just leave, because Bob is not worth your time.

What if the story was completely shaped by `your choices` - not just a few branches that lead toward a few endings - and you could see the impact of your actions in the world?

**Essentially, this is D&D.** It is one of many Tabletop RPGs, in this case geared toward a fantasy setting, that gives you unlimited options in how and what you play. But, because having an infinite sandbox is stressful and not actually fun, it provides rules, advice, and structure for navigating a world/setting and becoming more powerful to make it fun.

## A typical setting: The Forgotten Realms

The world can be anything that the DM and players can imagine. It could be a swords-and-sorcery setting at the dawn of civilization, where barbarians battle evil sorcerers, or a post-apocalyptic fantasy where elves and dwarves wield magic amid the wreckage of a technological civilization. Most D&D settings are somewhere between those two extremes: worlds of medieval high fantasy with knights and castles, as well as elven cities, dwarven mines, and fearsome monsters.

The world of the Forgotten Realms is one such setting, and that’s where the story in this adventure takes place. Knights dare the crypts of the fallen dwarf kings of Delzoun, seeking glory and treasure. Rogues prowl the dark alleyways of teeming cities such as Neverwinter and Baldur’s Gate. Clerics in the service of gods wield mace and spell, questing against the terrifying powers that threaten the land. Wizards plunder the ruins of a fallen empire, delving into secrets too dark for the light of day. Dragons, giants, demons, and unimaginables lurk in dungeons, caverns, ruined cities, and the vast wild places of the world.

On the roads and rivers of the Realms travel minstrels and peddlers, merchants and guards, soldiers, sailors, and steel-hearted adventurers carrying tales of strange, glorious, faraway places. Good maps and clear trails can take even an inexperienced youth with dreams of glory far across the world. Thousands of restless would-be heroes from backcountry farmsteads and sleepy villages arrive in Neverwinter and the other great cities every year in search of wealth and renown.

Known roads may be well-traveled, but they aren’t necessarily safe. Fell magic, deadly monsters, and cruel local rulers are all perils that you face when you travel in the Forgotten Realms. Even farms and freeholds within a day’s walk of a city can fall prey to monsters, and no place is safe from the sudden wrath of a dragon.

## TL;DR please

The world can be anything we want it to be - but let’s start here.

- This one is a medieval fantasy setting where magic, monsters, and god-like beings exist. Period. They play an enormous role in shaping history and society. (For instance, how would the world of Harry Potter change if magic were a part of regular society and not secreted away? Or our own reality?)
- The world is old and very well detailed.
- It’s exceptionally dangerous for the very reasons stated above.
- All of these points influence how the towns, cities, civilizations, etc are structured. It influences what kinds of organizations and people rise to power and how. It influences how people will react to you and the actions/choices you make in the game.

## The Flow of the Game

![Game Flow](game-flow.png)

The game generally flows as follows:

1. The GM describes the environment.
   1. Descriptive (Theater of the Mind) or Maps (when explicit positioning is important)
2. The players describe what they want to do or what more they want to know (and how they go about getting this info).
   1. Sometimes the GM will request a dice roll.
3. The GM narrates the results of the adventurers’ actions.

`Repeat.`
