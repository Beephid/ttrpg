## About

Welcome to my personal TTRPG reference site, dedicated to the wonderful world of tabletop role-playing games! Here you'll find a collection of resources, notes, and other information that I've gathered over the years. I hope you find it useful!

## Dungeons and Dragons 🐉

Explore the magical realm of Dungeons and Dragons, one of the most beloved and iconic TTRPGs ever created. Learn the basics with my [D&D Introduction](dnd/dnd-intro.md) and if you're playing in one of my games, check out the [House Rules and Expectations](dnd/house-rules.md).

## FATE 🎲

Delve into the narrative-driven world of FATE, where storytelling takes center stage. See the overview [FATE Introduction](fate/fate-intro.md) that compares and contrasts FATE with D&D. More to come!

## Notes 📝
