## Brett's Big Picture thoughts on D&D

> 1. The most important part is *that folks are having fun*. If absolutely anything at all feels off, or you have suggestions, *please tell me*. 
> 
> 2. *Your job as a player is to know your character and make choices about what you want to do and how you want to do it!* You don't have to know all the rules, especially not at first. That brings me to...
> 
> 3. *My job as a GM is to do everything else*. I figure out how your choices fit within the situation, the world, and the D&D ruleset. I provide the bones of the adventure and by playing, we flesh it out.
> 
> 4. D&D opens up a lot of space for roleplay - BUT! Roleplay has a super fluid definition. Don't feel pressured to speak in a voice other than your own or act out anything you are not comfortable with. *You can simply describe what is being said or done and how it is said or done and that makes for a wonderful experience!* (it's even indicated in the rules: https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/adventuring#Roleplaying) - *most situations come down to a roll of the dice and your stats, not your success at embodying your character.* 
> 
> The definition of roleplay that works best in this setting is making choices that your character would make, with the knowledge, history, and expertise they have (rather than choices you would make or think are best).
