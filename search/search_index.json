For a more detailed explanation, check out Chapter 1 of the Basic Rules. Then... the rest of it. Or just play the game and learn as you go! There's also a silly, albeit long, video overview of the character sheet in the Resources section.</p> <p>1. Character Sheet Overview: A D&amp;D character sheet is a document used to track the essential details of your player character. It contains various sections to record information such as your character's name, species, class, background, ability scores, skills, equipment, and more.</p> <p>2. Ability Scores: Ability scores represent your character's inherent strengths and weaknesses. They are numerical values that determine your character's capabilities in various aspects of the game. D&amp;D 5th Edition uses six ability scores:</p> <ul> <li>Strength (STR): Measures physical power, brute force, and carrying capacity.</li> <li>Dexterity (DEX): Represents agility, reflexes, and hand-eye coordination.</li> <li>Constitution (CON): Reflects endurance, health, and resilience.</li> <li>Intelligence (INT): Measures logic, reasoning, memory, and knowledge.</li> <li>Wisdom (WIS): Represents intuition, perception, and insight.</li> <li>Charisma (CHA): Reflects personality, presence, and social abilities.</li> </ul> <p>The scores range from 1 to 20, with 10 being the average for a typical human. During character creation, you will roll dice or use a point-buy system to determine these scores. Different species and classes might provide bonuses or penalties to specific ability scores, which can influence your character's playstyle and effectiveness.</p> <p>3. Skills: Skills are abilities or proficiencies that reflect your character's training, knowledge, and experience in certain areas. Each skill is associated with one of the six ability scores. For example:</p> <ul> <li>Acrobatics (DEX): Used for balance, tumbling, and other feats of agility.</li> <li>Investigation (INT): Reflects your character's ability to find and decipher clues.</li> <li>Perception (WIS): Represents your character's keenness of senses to notice details.</li> <li>Persuasion (CHA): Used to convince others and influence their opinions.</li> </ul> <p>The proficiency bonus is a key factor in determining your character's effectiveness with skills. As you gain levels, your proficiency bonus increases, making you better at skills you are proficient in.</p> <p>4. Class and Species Impact on Ability Scores and Skills: Choosing a species and class for your character can significantly impact their ability scores and skills:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Species: Each species grants specific ability score modifiers. For example, a species might give you a +2 bonus to Dexterity and a +1 bonus to Intelligence. This means your Dexterity score would increase by 2, and your Intelligence score would increase by 1. These modifiers help tailor your character's strengths based on their racial attributes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Class: Each class has preferred ability scores that enhance its effectiveness. For instance, a Fighter typically benefits from high Strength or Dexterity, while a Wizard relies on high Intelligence. Additionally, certain classes grant proficiency in specific skills, making your character more skilled in those areas.</p> </li> </ul> <p>When selecting a species and class, consider how their inherent abilities align with your desired playstyle and role in the party. For example, if you want to play a sneaky rogue, a species with a Dexterity bonus \ud83c\udff9 and a class that provides proficiency in Stealth and Sleight of Hand skills would be a good fit.</p> <p>Huge Caveat! \ud83d\udea8</p> <p>What you can do is not limited to the skills and actions on your character sheet.</p> <p>Your character sheet simply influences your likelihood of succeeding.</p> <p>If you have an idea of something you want to do, you can always try (or just ask!) and we will figure out what we need to roll to determine the outcome!</p>"},{"location":"dnd/dnd-intro/#a-few-big-picture-thoughts","title":"A few big picture thoughts \ud83c\udf20\ud83c\udfad","text":"<p>The most important part is that folks are having fun.

There was a fair bit of commotion about the town today. The Rockseeker Brothers from Neverwinter appear to have discovered something in the mountains east of Phandalin. I fear what it could be. I will alert the other Harpers as soon as I can. They will want to keep whatever it is out of the hands of anyone that may throw off the tenuous balance of the coast. But for now, my focus remains on the offshoot of the Many Arrows tribe out east. There\u2019s something off about these Redbrand fools, but it will have to wait as well.</p> <p>12 Ches 1491 I received a missive from Hreth detailing my next mission. There\u2019s a banshee residing near Conyberry to the east. She\u2019s at least as old as the previous settlement Phandalin now stands on and likely knows more about the orc activity to the east.  I hope Reidoth is doing well on his mission to the remains of Thundertree. I cannot imagine what could be of importance in that corrupted place. Nothing remains there but twisted plant life and those poor lost souls\u2026</p> <p>17 Ches 1491 I visited the banshee, Agatha, but she would not appear long for me. She told me she would only converse if I could settle an aspect of her past: retrieve a box from the Tower of Storms off the coast north of Leilon. She disappeared and offered no more details. It looks like I\u2019m off to the coast!</p> <p>2 Tarsakh 1491 I got it! It turns out the tower is owned by a mage. Before I reached it, in a cave along the path was another banshee. She was Agatha\u2019s sister but shared no goodwill toward Agatha. I am not sure of the story there, but I am not here for stories. I barely managed to escape, but I did get the box from her lair by acting quickly and turning her away with the grace of Tymora. Luckily, banshees are tied to their haunting and cannot travel far from them so she gave little chase.  The box itself is a strange one. It has four locks and came with four keys\u2026 I am not sure if I should try to open it before returning it to Agatha. I will sleep on it and decide in the morning.</p> <p></p> <p></p>"}]}
