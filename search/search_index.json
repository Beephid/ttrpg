For a more detailed explanation, check out Chapter 1 of the Basic Rules. Then... the rest of it. Or just play the game and learn as you go! There's also a silly, albeit long, video overview of the character sheet in the Resources section.</p> <p>1. Character Sheet Overview: A D&amp;D character sheet is a document used to track the essential details of your player character. It contains various sections to record information such as your character's name, race, class, background, ability scores, skills, equipment, and more.</p> <p>2. Ability Scores: Ability scores represent your character's inherent strengths and weaknesses. They are numerical values that determine your character's capabilities in various aspects of the game. D&amp;D 5th Edition uses six ability scores:</p> <ul> <li>Strength (STR): Measures physical power, brute force, and carrying capacity.</li> <li>Dexterity (DEX): Represents agility, reflexes, and hand-eye coordination.</li> <li>Constitution (CON): Reflects endurance, health, and resilience.</li> <li>Intelligence (INT): Measures logic, reasoning, memory, and knowledge.</li> <li>Wisdom (WIS): Represents intuition, perception, and insight.</li> <li>Charisma (CHA): Reflects personality, presence, and social abilities.</li> </ul> <p>The scores range from 1 to 20, with 10 being the average for a typical human. During character creation, you will roll dice or use a point-buy system to determine these scores. Different races and classes might provide bonuses or penalties to specific ability scores, which can influence your character's playstyle and effectiveness.</p> <p>3. Skills: Skills are abilities or proficiencies that reflect your character's training, knowledge, and experience in certain areas. Each skill is associated with one of the six ability scores. For example:</p> <ul> <li>Acrobatics (DEX): Used for balance, tumbling, and other feats of agility.</li> <li>Investigation (INT): Reflects your character's ability to find and decipher clues.</li> <li>Perception (WIS): Represents your character's keenness of senses to notice details.</li> <li>Persuasion (CHA): Used to convince others and influence their opinions.</li> </ul> <p>The proficiency bonus is a key factor in determining your character's effectiveness with skills. As you gain levels, your proficiency bonus increases, making you better at skills you are proficient in.</p> <p>4. Class and Race Impact on Ability Scores and Skills: Choosing a race and class for your character can significantly impact their ability scores and skills:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Race: Each race grants specific ability score modifiers. For example, a race might give you a +2 bonus to Dexterity and a +1 bonus to Intelligence. This means your Dexterity score would increase by 2, and your Intelligence score would increase by 1. These modifiers help tailor your character's strengths based on their racial attributes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Class: Each class has preferred ability scores that enhance its effectiveness. For instance, a Fighter typically benefits from high Strength or Dexterity, while a Wizard relies on high Intelligence. Additionally, certain classes grant proficiency in specific skills, making your character more skilled in those areas.</p> </li> </ul> <p>When selecting a race and class, consider how their inherent abilities align with your desired playstyle and role in the party. For example, if you want to play a sneaky rogue, a race with a Dexterity bonus \ud83c\udff9 and a class that provides proficiency in Stealth and Sleight of Hand skills would be a good fit.</p> <p>Huge Caveat! \ud83d\udea8</p> <p>What you can do is not limited to the skills and actions on your character sheet.</p> <p>Your character sheet simply influences your likelihood of succeeding.</p> <p>If you have an idea of something you want to do, you can always try (or just ask!) and we will figure out what we need to roll to determine the outcome!</p>"},{"location":"dnd/dnd-intro/#a-few-big-picture-thoughts","title":"A few big picture thoughts \ud83c\udf20\ud83c\udfad","text":"<p>The most important part is that folks are having fun.

I barely managed to escape, but I did get the box from her lair by acting quickly and turning her away with the grace of Tymora. Luckily, banshees are tied to their haunting and cannot travel far from them so she gave little chase.  The box itself is a strange one.
